In util folder
                Purpose:
                Holds utility/helper classes — mainly things you reuse across your app.
                Example:
                DBConnection.java connects to your database, so you don’t repeat connection code everywhere.
                Use case:
                Centralized control over DB connection.
                Easy to modify if you change DB config or switch to another DB.
