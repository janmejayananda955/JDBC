Purpose:
        This is where your application starts (like public static void main(String[] args)).
Example:
        MainApp.java might call methods from UserDao to perform real actions.
Use case:
        It’s your program's "brain" — uses everything from the other folders to perform tasks.
        Keeps your entry point clean and modular.
